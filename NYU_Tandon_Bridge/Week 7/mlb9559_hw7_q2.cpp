/*
NYU Tandon Bridge - Week 7 (Winter 2024)
Perfect and Amicable Numbers Calculator

Assignment:
Implement functions to work with special number relationships:

1. void analyzeDividors(int num, int& outCountDivs, int& outSumDivs)
   - Finds proper divisors (all divisors except number itself)
   - Must run in O(âˆšnum) time
   - Updates count and sum of proper divisors

2. bool isPerfect(int num)
   - Perfect number equals sum of its proper divisors
   - Example: 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
   - Uses analyzeDividors function

3. Main program to find:
   - All perfect numbers between 2 and M
   - All amicable number pairs between 2 and M
   - Amicable pairs: each number equals sum of other's proper divisors
   - Example: 220 and 284 are amicable

Example interaction:
Please enter a positive integer M that is >=2: 300
The set of perfect numbers between 2 and entered number consists of:
6
28

The pairs of amicable numbers that are between 2 and entered number are:
(220, 284)
