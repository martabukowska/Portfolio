NYU Tandon Bridge - Week 3 (Winter 2024)
BMI Calculator

Original Assignment:
Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height using the
formula: weight/heightÂ². Where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.

BMI ranges and corresponding weight status:
- Below 18.5: Underweight
- [18.5, 25): Normal
- [25, 30): Overweight
- 30 and above: Obese

Write a program that prompts for weight (in pounds) and height (in inches) of a person,
and prints the weight status of that person.

Note: 1 pound is 0.453592 kilograms and 1 inch is 0.0254 meters.

Example interaction:
Please enter weight (in pounds): 135
Please enter height (in inches): 71
The weight status is: Normal
