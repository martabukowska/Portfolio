/*
NYU Tandon Bridge - Week 11 (Winter 2024)
Recursive Minimum Value Finder

Assignment:
Implement two recursive versions of minInArray:

1. int minInArray1(int arr[], int arrSize)
   - Takes array and its logical size
   - Finds minimum in range [0, arrSize-1]

2. int minInArray2(int arr[], int low, int high)
   - Takes array and range bounds
   - Finds minimum in range [low, high]
   - Assumes low â‰¤ high

Test with:
int arr[10] = {9, -2, 14, 12, 3, 6, 2, 1, -9, 15};
res1 = minInArray1(arr, 10);      // -9
res2 = minInArray2(arr, 0, 9);    // -9
res3 = minInArray2(arr, 2, 5);    // 3
res4 = minInArray1(arr+2, 4);     // 3

Requirements:
- Must use recursion
- No loops allowed
